# Silent Archives  
A stealth-based keylogger wrapped inside a snake game. Built for research and ethical hacking.


# How does this work?
basically, both are different python programs that can be packaged to execute together. Keeping the victim unaware of the keylogger (snake) running in the background.


# Why did you make this?
for fun.


# Can it be used for wrong reasons?
yes, it can. Which is why I'm showing it, so people might have an idea of how *unsafe* downloading unauthorized sources might be.
